# Peer Review: TechDemo – Web Service Development

## General Information

* **Title of the TechDemo**: Delivery App using REST API & Websockets
* **Presenter(s)**: Mihajlo Ilijic
* **Reviewer (your name)**: Oleksandra Annawitt
* **Date of the Demo**: 17.06.2025

## 1. Technical Implementation

**Evaluate how well the solution meets the requirements.**

* [x] Core functionality works (e.g., API calls, authentication)
* [x] Clear code structure / architecture
* [x] Best practices applied (e.g., conventions, error handling)
* [x] Data flow and integration were well explained

**Comments / Suggestions for improvement**:

> **Strengths:**
> - Well-structured MVC architecture with clear separation of concerns
> - Comprehensive REST API with proper HTTP methods and status codes
> - Real-time WebSocket implementation for live delivery updates
> - JWT-based authentication with proper middleware
> - MongoDB integration
> - Responsive frontend with modern UI/UX design
> - Proper error handling throughout the application
>
> **Areas for improvement:**
> - The WebSocket implementation uses raw WebSocket instead of Socket.IO (which is in dependencies but not used)
> - Missing input validation
> - Missing comprehensive error logging

> - Real-time communication with WebSockets


## 4. Presentation & Communication

**How well was the content presented and explained?**

* [x] Clear and understandable language
* [x] Good time management
* [x] Visuals or live demo supported the explanation
* [x] Questions were addressed effectively

**Comments / Suggestions for improvement**:

> **Strong presentation aspects:**
> - Clear code structure makes it easy to follow
> - Well-documented API endpoints
> - Comprehensive README with setup instructions
> - Good use of comments in code
>
> **Presentation could be enhanced by:**
> - Discussion of design decisions and trade-offs

## 5. Overall Feedback

* **What worked particularly well?**

> - **Architecture**: Clean MVC pattern with proper separation of concerns
> - **Real-time features**: WebSocket implementation for live updates
> - **User experience**: Intuitive frontend with responsive design
> - **API design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
